The Web site also includes all the project materials—about 200 test programs\\nand test scripts, allowing incremental development and unit-testing of each one of the 12 projects. All the supplied software tools and project\\nmaterials can be used as is on any computer equipped with either Windows or Linux.\\nTo our parents,\\nFor teaching us that less is more.\\nPreface\\n \\nWhat I hear, I forget; What I see, I remember; What I do, I understand.\\n—Confucius, 551-479 BC\\n \\n \\nOnce upon a time, every computer specialist had a gestalt understanding of how computers worked. The\\noverall interactions among hardware, software, compilers, and the operating system were simple and\\ntransparent enough to produce a coherent picture of the computer’s operations. As modern computer\\ntechnologies have become increasingly more complex, this clarity is all but lost: the most fundamental\\nideas and techniques in computer science—the very essence of the field—are now hidden under many\\nlayers of obscure interfaces and proprietary implementations. An inevitable consequence of this\\ncomplexity has been specialization, leading to computer science curricula of many courses, each covering\\na single aspect of the field.\\nWe wrote this book because we felt that many computer science students are missing the forest for the\\ntrees. The typical student is marshaled through a series of courses in programming, theory, and\\nengineering, without pausing to appreciate the beauty of the picture at large. And the picture at large is\\nsuch that hardware and software systems are tightly interrelated through a hidden web of abstractions,\\ninterfaces, and contract-based implementations. Failure to see this intricate enterprise in the flesh leaves\\nmany students and professionals with an uneasy feeling that, well, they don’t fully understand what’s\\ngoing on inside computers.\\nWe believe that the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch. With that\\nin mind, we came up with the following concept. Let’s specify a simple but sufficiently powerful\\ncomputer system, and have the students build its hardware platform and software hierarchy from the\\nground up, starting with nothing more than elementary logic gates. And while we are at it, let’s do it right.\\nWe say this because building a general-purpose computer from first principles is a huge undertaking.\\nTherefore, we identified a unique educational opportunity not only to build the thing, but also to illustrate,\\nin a hands-on fashion, how to effectively plan and manage large-scale hardware and software\\ndevelopment projects. In addition, we sought to demonstrate the ability to construct, through recursive\\nascent and human reasoning, fantastically complex and useful systems from nothing more than a few\\nprimitive building blocks.\\nScope\\n \\nThe book exposes students to a significant body of computer science knowledge, gained through a series\\nof hardware and software construction tasks. These tasks demonstrate how theoretical and applied\\ntechniques taught in other computer science courses are used in practice. In particular, the following\\ntopics are illustrated in a hands-on fashion:\\n \\n■ \\nHardware:\\n Logic gates, Boolean arithmetic, multiplexors, flip-flops, registers, RAM units, counters,\\nHardware Description Language (HDL), chip simulation and testing.\\n■ \\nArchitecture:\\n ALU/CPU design and implementation, machine code, assembly language programming,\\naddressing modes, memory-mapped input/output (I/O).\\n■ \\nOperating systems:\\n Memory management, math library, basic I/O drivers, screen management, file I/O,\\nhigh-level language support.\\n■ \\nProgramming languages:\\n Object-based design and programming, abstract data types, scoping rules,\\nsyntax and semantics, references.\\n■ \\nCompilers:\\n Lexical analysis, top-down parsing, symbol tables, virtual stack-based machine, code\\ngeneration, implementation of arrays and objects.\\n■ \\nData structures and algorithms:\\n Stacks, hash tables, lists, recursion, arithmetic algorithms, geometric\\nalgorithms, running time considerations.\\n■ \\nSoftware engineering:\\n Modular design, the interface/implementation paradigm, API design and\\ndocumentation, proactive test planning, programming at the large, quality assurance.\\n \\nAll these topics are presented with a very clear purpose: building a modern computer from the ground\\nup. In fact, this has been our topic selection rule: The book focuses on the minimal set of topics necessary\\nfor building a fully functioning computer system. As it turns out, this set includes many fundamental ideas\\nin applied computer science.\\nCourses\\n \\nThe book is intended for students of computer science and other engineering disciplines in colleges and\\nuniversities, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. A course based on this book is\\n“perpendicular” to the normal computer science curriculum and can be taken at almost any point during\\nthe program. Two natural slots are “CS-2”—immediately after learning programming, and “CS-199”—a\\ncapstone course coming at the end of the program. The former course can provide a systems-oriented\\nintroduction to computer science, and the latter an integrative, project-oriented systems building course.\\nPossible names for such courses may be Constructive Introduction to Computer Science, Elements of\\nComputing Systems, Digital Systems Construction, Computer Construction Workshop, Let’s Build a\\nComputer, and the like. The book can support both one- and two-semester courses, depending on topic\\nselection and pace of work.\\nThe book is completely self-contained, requiring only programming (in any language) as a prerequisite.\\nThus, it lends itself not only to computer science majors, but also to computer-savvy students seeking to\\ngain a hands-on view of hardware architectures, operating systems, and modern software engineering in\\nthe framework of one course. The book and the accompanying Web site can also be used as a self-study\\nlearning unit, suitable to students from any technical or scientific discipline following a programming\\ncourse.\\nStructure\\n \\nThe introduction chapter presents our approach and previews the main hardware and software\\nabstractions discussed in the book. This sets the stage for chapters 1-12, each dedicated to a key\\nhardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation, and an actual project that builds and tests\\nit. The first five chapters focus on constructing the hardware platform of a simple modern computer. The\\nremaining seven chapters describe the design and implementation of a typical multi-tier software\\nhierarchy, culminating in the construction of an object-based programming language and a simple\\noperating system. The complete game plan is depicted in figure P.1.\\nThe book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm. Each chapter starts with a Background\\nsection, describing relevant concepts and a generic hardware or software system. The next section is\\nalways Specification, which provides a clear statement of the system’s abstraction—namely, the various\\nservices that it is expected to deliver. Having presented the what, each chapter proceeds to discuss how\\nthe abstraction can be implemented, leading to a (proposed) Implementation section. The next section is\\nalways Perspective, in which we highlight noteworthy issues left out from the chapter. Each chapter ends\\nwith a Project section that provides step-by-step building instructions, testing materials, and software\\ntools for actually building and unit-testing the system described in the chapter.\\n \\nFigure P.1\\n Book and proposed course map, with chapter numbers in circles.\\n \\n \\nProjects\\n \\nThe computer system described in the book is \\nfor real\\n—it can actually be built, and it works! A reader\\nwho takes the time and effort to gradually build this computer will gain a level of intimate understanding\\nunmatched by mere reading. Hence, the book is geared toward active readers who are willing to roll up\\ntheir sleeves and build a computer from the ground up.\\nEach chapter includes a complete description of a stand-alone hardware or software development\\nproject. The four projects that construct the computer platform are built using a simple Hardware\\nDescription Language (HDL) and simulated on a hardware simulator supplied with the book. Five of the\\nsubsequent software projects (assembler, virtual machine I and II, and compiler I and II) can be written in\\nany modern programming language. The remaining three projects (low-level programming, high-level\\nprogramming, and the operating system) are written in the assembly language and high-level language\\nimplemented in previous projects.\\n \\nProject Tips\\n There are twelve projects altogether. On average, each project entails a weekly homework\\nload in a typical, rigorous university-level course. The projects are completely self-contained and can be\\ndone (or skipped) in any desired order. Of course the “full experience” package requires doing all the\\nprojects in their order of appearance, but this is just one option.\\nWhen we teach courses based on this book, we normally make two significant concessions. First,\\nexcept for obvious cases, we pay no attention to optimization, leaving this very important subject to other,\\nmore specific courses. Second, when developing the translators suite (assembler, VM implementation,\\nand compiler), we supply error-free test files (source programs), allowing the students to assume that the\\ninputs of these translators are error-free. This eliminates the need to write code for handling errors and\\nexceptions, making the software projects significantly more manageable. Dealing with incorrect input is\\nof course critically important, but once again we assume that students can hone this skill elsewhere, for\\nexample, in dedicated programming and software design courses.\\nSoftware\\n \\nThe book’s Web site (\\nwww.idc.ac.il/tecs\\n) provides the tools and materials necessary to build all the\\nhardware and software systems described in the book. These include a hardware simulator, a CPU\\nemulator, a VM emulator, and executable versions of the assembler, virtual machine, compiler, and\\noperating system described in the book. The Web site also includes all the project materials—about two\\nhundred test programs and test scripts, allowing incremental development and unit-testing of each one of\\nthe twelve projects. All the supplied software tools and project materials can be used as is on any\\ncomputer equipped with either Windows or Linux.\\nAcknowledgments\\n \\nAll the software that accompanies the book was developed by our students at the Efi Arazi School of\\nComputer Science of the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, a new Israeli university. The chief software\\narchitect was Yaron Ukrainitz, and the developers included Iftach Amit, Nir Rozen, Assaf Gad, and\\nHadar Rosen-Sior. Working with these student-developers has been a great pleasure, and we feel proud\\nand fortunate to have had the opportunity to play a role in their education. We also wish to thank our\\nteaching assistants, Muawyah Akash, David Rabinowitz, Ran Navok, and Yaron Ukrainitz, who helped us\\nrun early versions of the course that led to this book. Thanks also to Jonathan Gross and Oren Baranes,\\nwho worked on related projects under the excellent supervision of Dr. Danny Seidner, to Uri Zeira and\\nOren Cohen, for designing an integrated development environment for the Jack language, to Tal Achituv,\\nfor useful advice on open source issues, and to Aryeh Schnall, for careful reading and meticulous editing\\nsuggestions.\\nWriting the book without taking any reduction in our regular professional duties was not simple, and so\\nwe wish to thank esti romem, administrative director of the EFI Arazi School of Computer Science, for\\nholding the fort in difficult times. Finally, we are indebted to the many students who endured early\\nversions of this book and helped polish it through numerous bug reports. In the process, we hope, they\\nhave learned first-hand that insight of James Joyce, that mistakes are the portals of discovery.\\n \\nNoam Nisan\\n \\nShimon Schocken\\n \\nFigure I.1\\n The major abstractions underlying the design of a typical computing system.

You are about to learn three things: how computers work, how to\\nbreak complex problems into manageable modules, and how to develop large-scale hardware and\\nsoftware systems. This will be a hands-on process as you create a complete and working computer system\\nfrom the ground up. The lessons you will learn, which are far more important and general than the\\ncomputer itself, will be gained as side effects of this activity. According to the psychologist Carl Rogers,\\n“the only kind of learning which significantly influences behavior is self-discovered or self-appropriated\\n—truth that has been assimilated in experience.” This chapter sketches some of the discoveries, truths,\\nand experiences that lie ahead.\\nThe World Above\\n \\nIf you have taken any programming course, you’ve probably encountered something like the program\\nbelow early in your education. This particular program is written in \\nJack\\n—a simple high-level language\\nthat has a conventional object-based syntax.\\n \\nTrivial programs like Hello World are deceptively simple. Did you ever think about what it takes to\\nactually run such a program on a computer? Let’s look under the hood. For starters, note that the program\\nis nothing more than a bunch of dead characters stored in a text file. Thus, the first thing we must do is\\nparse this text, uncover its semantics, and reexpress it in some low-level language understood by our\\ncomputer. The result of this elaborate translation process, known as compilation, will be yet another text\\nfile, containing machine-level code.\\nOf course machine language is also an abstraction—an agreed upon set of binary codes. In order to\\nmake this abstract formalism concrete, it must be realized by some hardware architecture. And this\\narchitecture, in turn, is implemented by a certain chip \\nset\\n—registers, memory units, ALU, and so on.\\nNow, every one of these hardware devices is constructed from an integrated package of elementary logic\\ngates. And these gates, in turn, can be built from primitive gates like Nand and Nor. Of course every one\\nof these gates consists of several switching devices, typically implemented by transistors. And each\\ntransistor is made of—Well, we won’t go further than that, because that’s where computer science ends\\nand physics starts.\\nYou may be thinking: “On my computer, compiling and running a program is much easier—all I have to\\ndo is click some icons or write some commands!” Indeed, a modern computer system is like a huge\\niceberg, and most people get to see only the top. Their knowledge of computing systems is sketchy and\\nsuperficial. If, however, you wish to explore beneath the surface, then lucky you! There’s a fascinating\\nworld down there, made of some of the most beautiful stuff in computer science. An intimate\\nunderstanding of this underworld is one of the things that separate naïve programmers from sophisticated\\ndevelopers—people who can create not only application programs, but also complex hardware and\\nsoftware technologies. And the best way to understand how these technologies work—and we mean\\nunderstand them in the marrow of your bones—is to build a complete computer system from scratch.\\nAbstractions\\n \\nYou may wonder how it is humanly possible to construct a complete computer system from the ground up,\\nstarting with nothing more than elementary logic gates. This must be an enormously complex enterprise!\\nWe deal with this complexity by breaking the project into modules, and treating each module separately,\\nin a stand-alone chapter. You might then wonder, how is it possible to describe and construct these\\nmodules in isolation? Obviously they are all interrelated! As we will show throughout the book, a good\\nmodular design implies just that: You can work on the individual modules independently, while\\ncompletely ignoring the rest of the system. In fact, you can even build these modules in any desired order!\\nIt turns out that this strategy works well thanks to a special gift unique to humans: our ability to create\\nand use abstractions. The notion of abstraction, central to many arts and sciences, is normally taken to be\\na mental expression that seeks to separate in thought, and capture in some concise manner, the essence of\\nsome entity. In computer science, we take the notion of abstraction very concretely, defining it to be a\\nstatement of “what the entity does” and ignoring the details of “how it does it.” This functional description\\nmust capture all that needs to be known in order to use the entity’s services, and'"
